								<p>Hi, welcome to my website!</p>
								<p>I'm Ryan. I am a third year cyber security student at Deakin University. Technically I'm in my fourth year of uni, because I did mechatronics for a year before I realised I enjoyed working with software more than hardware.</p>
								<p>This site serves as a portfolio for my projects and a journal of my learning.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm 23 years old and I love learning new things and creating things that didn't previously exist.</p>
								<p>I'm from Victoria, Australia, and I really suck at writing about myself.</p>
								<p>I will now copy and paste the <i>About</i> section from my <u><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-allan-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >LinkedIn:</a></u></p>
								<blockquote>

								<p>Some of my projects are detailed here. If you would like to see the source code for them or get more information you can click the headings for any project to go to the project's <u> <a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >GitHub</a></u> page.</p>

								<!-- Crypto Portfolio Tracker -->
								<hr />
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/CryptoPortfolioTracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" ><h2>Crypto Portfolio Tracker</h2></a>
								<h4>Language: Python</h4>
								<p>Multiple crypto portfolio tracker using the 🟪<u><a href="https://nomics.com/docs/#tag/Currencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nomics cryptocurrency API</a></u>.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/multi.gif" alt="Demonstration of project" /></span>
								<p>Tracks as many crypto portfolios as you want, updates 10x per second by queing two API responses at once, comparing their values, calculating an increment, and then smoothly updating to reduce stagnant periods.</p>
								<p>Easily add, remove or modify portfolio holdings by modifying dictionaries. To add a portfolio you just need to create a dictionary where the keys are crypto token tag names and the values are how many of that crypto the portfolio owns. </p>
								<p>See the example below.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/portfolio_examples.png" alt="Example portfolios" /></span>
								<p>Also features dynamic formatting, so each portfolio can be coloured based on the direction it is currently heading:</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/colour_demo.jpg" alt="Colour demonstration" /></span>
								<p>For more information check out the project's <u><a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/CryptoPortfolioTracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >GitHub page</a></u>, because I actually put effort into the ReadMe for this one and it tells you how to run it locally and stuff.</p>
								<!-- FollowersTools -->
								<hr />
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/FollowersTools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  ><h2> FollowersTools</h2></a>
								<p><i>Unfortunately, these scripts no longer work as Instagram have modified their UI since I wrote them.</i></p>
								<!-- Instagram Follower Tool -->
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/FollowersTools/blob/main/Instagram%20Followers.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="major" ><h3> Instagram Followers</h3></a>
								<h4>Language: Python w/ Selenium</h4>
								<p>This Python script uses Selenium in headless mode to analyse any Instagram account's followers and following. </p>
								<p>It generates 3 .txt files:
								<ol>
									<li>"[account]_followers.txt", which lists every account that follows them.</li>
									<li>"[account]_following.txt", which lists every account that they follow.</li>
									<li>"[account]_scum.txt"*, which is generated by comparing the two prior files and finding accounts that don't follow back.</li>
								</ol></p>
								<sup><i>*"scum" is hyperbole, no doubt they're fine people.</i></sup>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/followers.gif" alt="Demonstration of project" /></span>
								<!-- Instagram Unfollower Tool -->
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/FollowersTools/blob/main/Unfollower.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="major" ><h3>Unfollower</h3></a>
								<h4>Language: Python w/ Selenium</h4>
								<p>Once you've got the .txt files from above, you can yeet the fake friends by feeding the output straight into this script.</p>
								<p>You can edit the .txt file before input to stop it from unfollowing accounts that you like, or create a new .txt file completely. The script loops through the lines in the chosen .txt file, loading their instagram accounts, locating the unfollow button, and clicking it.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, if you run this script too fast your account may be temporarily limited. From my experience around 40 unfollows per hour is fine.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/unfollower.gif" alt="Demonstration of project" /></span>
								<p>I ran this script on my own account with the following outcome:</p>

								<!-- Life Progress -->
								<hr />
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/life_progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="major" ><h2>Life Progress Visualiser</h2></a>
								<h4>Language: Python</h4>
								<p>Visualises life progress as a percentage, progress bar, and by printing red circles for every day lived, and green circles for every day you're expected to live.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/life_progress.png" alt="Demonstration of project" /></span>
								<p>Features an easily changeable birthdate in a birthdate.txt file, allowing the user to change the function of the app for different aged people. I developed this as a quick way to instill the fear of death in myself and help me stop procrastinating.</p>
								<span class="image png"><img src="images/birthdate_txt.png" alt="File structure demonstration" /></span>
								<!-- changeFinder -->
								<hr />
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/ChangeFinder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="major" ><h2>ChangeFinder</h2></a>
								<h4>Language: Python</h4>
								<p>Super simple Python change finder script. I was helping a friend with his C assignment, which was to make something similar to this, and I made this to help him approach the task programmatically.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/change1.gif" alt="Demonstration of project" /></span>
								<p>Modifiable for different variations of currency (eg. 25 cent coins vs 20 cent coins, or removing coins/notes which you don't have at hand).</p>
								<p>Here's a demonstration modified to find change for Indian Rupees:</p>

								<!-- Euclid's Algo Solver -->
								<hr />
								<a href="https://github.com/lawrence0arabia/Euclid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" ><h2>Euclid's Algorithm Solver</h2></a>
								<h4>Language: Python</h4>
								<p>During my cryptography unit in my second year of cyber security, I found myself performing the Euclidean algorithm tediously by hand over and over for pracs and assignments. I wondered if I could write a simple Python script to perform the calculations for me and output the answer with working, culminating in this simple Python script.</p>

								<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</p>
								<h3>Insurance Australia Group (IAG)</h3>
								<h4>API Development Intern (Mar 2021 - Sep 2021) </h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/iag.jpg" alt="Me with some IAG and Deakin staff at the IAG office in Melbourne" /></span>
								<p>My 6 month full-time internship at IAG flew by as I continually learnt new technologies, made new friends, and developed my professional skills.</p>
								<p>IAG was my first experience of work outside of McDonalds (and a 2 week stint at the City of Greater Geelong for work experience when I was 16), so it was a major professional development opportunity for me which I took full advantage of.</p>
								<p>The team at IAG were incredibly supportive and we had developed some real camaraderie by the end of my time there. Huge thanks to Dragonfly team in particular for putting up with my incessant questions and occasional mistakes, you guys were amazing.</p> 
								<span class="image png"><img src="images/iag_logo.png" alt="IAG logo" /></span>
								<p>In my time at IAG I learnt and used many tools and technologies including:</p>
								<ul class="two">
									<li>Java</li>
									<li>MicroServices/APIs</li>
									<li>GitBucket</li>
									<li>Spring/Spring Boot</li>
									<li>Bamboo CI/CD</li>
									<li>Swagger</li>
									<li>Confluence</li>
									<li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
									<li>JIRA</li>
									<li>SonarQube</li>
									<li>Python</li>
									<li>Bash scripting</li>
